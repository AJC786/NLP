These tasks are so hard that Turing could rightly make fluent conversation in natural language the centerpiece of his test for intelligence.\\n\\nâ Page 248, Mathematical Linguistics, 2010.\\n\\nNatural language is primarily hard because it is messy.

Mathematicians working on natural language may refer to their study as mathematical linguistics, focusing exclusively on the use of discrete mathematical formalisms and theory for natural language (e.g. formal languages and automata theory).\\n\\nComputational Linguistics\\nComputational linguistics is the modern study of linguistics using the tools of computer science. Yesterdayâs linguistics may be todayâs computational linguist as the use of computational tools and thinking has overtaken most fields of study.\\n\\nComputational linguistics is the study of computer systems for understanding and generating natural language. â¦ One natural function for computational linguistics would be the testing of grammars proposed by theoretical linguists.\\n\\nâ Pages 4-5, Computational Linguistics: An Introduction, 1986.\\n\\nLarge data and fast computers mean that new and different things can be discovered from large datasets of text by writing and running software.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, statistical methods and statistical machine learning began to and eventually replaced the classical top-down rule-based approaches to language, primarily because of their better results, speed, and robustness. The statistical approach to studying natural language now dominates the field; it may define the field.\\n\\nData-Drive methods for natural language processing have now become so popular that they must be considered mainstream approaches to computational linguistics. â¦ A strong contributing factor to this development is undoubtedly the increase amount of available electronically stored data to which these methods can be applied; another factor might be a certain disenchantment with approaches relying exclusively on hand-crafted rules, due to their observed brittleness.\\n\\nâ Page 358, The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics, 2005.\\n\\nThe statistical approach to natural language is not limited to statistics per-se, but also to advanced inference methods like those used in applied machine learning.\\n\\nâ¦ understanding natural language require large amounts of knowledge about morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatics as well as general knowledge about the world.

The engineering side of computational linguistics, often called natural language processing (NLP), is largely concerned with building computational tools that do useful things with language, e.g., machine translation, summarization, question-answering, etc. Like any engineering discipline, natural language processing draws on a variety of different scientific disciplines.\\n\\nâ How the statistical revolution changes (computational) linguistics, 2009.\\n\\nLinguistics is a large topic of study, and, although the statistical approach to NLP has shown great success in some areas, there is still room and great benefit from the classical top-down methods.\\n\\nRoughly speaking, statistical NLP associates probabilities with the alternatives encountered in the course of analyzing an utterance or a text and accepts the most probable outcome as the correct one. â¦ Not surprisingly, words that name phenomena that are closely related in the world, or our perception of it, frequently occur close to one another so that crisp facts about the world are reflected in somewhat fuzzier facts about texts. There is much room for debate in this view.\\n\\nâ Page xix, The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics, 2005.\\n\\nNatural Language Processing\\nAs machine learning practitioners interested in working with text data, we are concerned with the tools and methods from the field of Natural Language Processing.\\n\\nWe have seen the path from linguistics to NLP in the previous section. Now, letâs take a look at how modern researchers and practitioners define what NLP is all about.\\n\\nIn perhaps one of the more widely textbooks written by top researchers in the field, they refer to the subject as âlinguistic science,â permitting discussion of both classical linguistics and modern statistical methods.\\n\\nThe aim of a linguistic science is to be able to characterize and explain the multitude of linguistic observations circling around us, in conversations, writing, and other media. Part of that has to do with the cognitive size of how humans acquire, produce and understand language, part of it has to do with understanding the relationship between linguistic utterances and the world, and part of it has to do with understand the linguistic structures by which language communicates.\\n\\nâ Page 3, Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, 1999.\\n\\nThey go on to focus on inference through the use of statistical methods in natural language processing.\\n\\nStatistical NLP aims to do statistical inference for the field of natural language. Statistical inference in general consists of taking some data (generated in accordance with some unknown probability distribution) and then making some inference about this distribution.\\n\\nâ Page 191, Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, 1999.\\n\\nIn their text on applied natural language processing, the authors and contributors to the popular NLTK Python library for NLP describe the field broadly as using computers to work with natural language data.\\n\\nWe will take Natural Language Processing â or NLP for short âin a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme, NLP involves âunderstandingâ complete human utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful responses to them.\\n\\nâ Page ix, Natural Language Processing with Python, 2009.\\n\\nStatistical NLP has turned another corner and is now strongly focused on the use of deep learning neural networks to both perform inference on specific tasks and for developing robust end-to-end systems.\\n\\nIn one of the first textbooks dedicated to this emerging topic, Yoav Goldberg succinctly defines NLP as automatic methods that take natural language as input or produce natural language as output.\\n\\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a collective term referring to automatic computational processing of human languages.

Part of that has to do with the cognitive size of how humans acquire, produce and understand language, part of it has to do with understanding the relationship between linguistic utterances and the world, and part of it has to do with understand the linguistic structures by which language communicates.\n","\n","â Page 3, Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, 1999.\n","\n","They go on to focus on inference through the use of statistical methods in natural language processing.\n","\n","Statistical NLP aims to do statistical inference for the field of natural language. Statistical inference in general consists of taking some data (generated in accordance with some unknown probability distribution) and then making some inference about this distribution.\n","\n","â Page 191, Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, 1999.\n","\n","In their text on applied natural language processing, the authors and contributors to the popular NLTK Python library for NLP describe the field broadly as using computers to work with natural language data.\n","\n","We will take Natural Language Processing â or NLP for short âin a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme, NLP involves âunderstandingâ complete human utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful responses to them.\n","\n","â Page ix, Natural Language Processing with Python, 2009.\n","\n","Statistical NLP has turned another corner and is now strongly focused on the use of deep learning neural networks to both perform inference on specific tasks and for developing robust end-to-end systems.\n","\n","In one of the first textbooks dedicated to this emerging topic, Yoav Goldberg succinctly defines NLP as automatic methods that take natural language as input or produce natural language as output.\n","\n","Natural language processing (NLP) is a collective term referring to automatic computational processing of human languages. This includes both algorithms that take human-produced text as input, and algorithms that produce natural looking text as outputs.\n","\n","â Page xvii, Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2017.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:1: DeprecationWarning: 'U' mode is deprecated\n","  \"\"\"Entry point for launching an IPython kernel.\n"],"name":"stderr"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hLSyWDrLEV8b"},"source":["s = input(\"Enter some text: \")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-l9KMRkIFcdP"},"source":["print(\"You typed\", len(word_tokenize(s)), \"words.\")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3C8oMtl_Fhjp"},"source":["**The NLP Pipeline**\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qIBFII3wFr-3"},"source":["raw = open('NLP.txt').read()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9EncwB63GCuC"},"source":["type(raw)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"CyHRyI23GGZl"},"source":["tokens = word_tokenize(raw)\n","type(tokens)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"TIIGTJ5KGKpg"},"source":["words = [w.lower() for w in tokens]\n","type(words)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gWX67uKcGPcn"},"source":["vocab = sorted(set(words))\n","type(vocab)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
